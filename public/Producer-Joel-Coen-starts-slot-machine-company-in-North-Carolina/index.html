<p>Coen’s company, named “Juke Joint Casino”, will be based in the small town of Mount Olive and is expected to create over 100 jobs in the area. The company has already ordered dozens of slot machines from leading manufacturers and plans to open its doors in early 2020.</p>
<p>In a statement, Coen said: “We’re really excited about this new venture. Slot machines are becoming increasingly popular in casinos all over the country, and we believe there’s a lot of potential for growth in the North Carolina market.”</p>
<p>Mount Olive Mayor Everette Blackwelder welcomed the news, saying: “This is great news for our town. Juke Joint Casino is going to bring jobs and economic growth to our community, and we can’t wait to see it open its doors next year.”</p>
<h1 id="Joel-Coen-starts-up-slot-machine-company-in-new-location"><a href="#Joel-Coen-starts-up-slot-machine-company-in-new-location" class="headerlink" title="Joel Coen starts up slot machine company in new location"></a>Joel Coen starts up slot machine company in new location</h1><p>After more than a decade of filmmaking, Joel Coen has decided to start up his own slot machine company. Called SlotCo, the new business is located in a new, undisclosed location.</p>
<p>“I’ve always been interested in slot machines,” Coen said in a statement. “And I think there’s a lot of potential in the industry.”</p>
<p>SlotCo will produce and distribute its own line of slot machines, which will be available at casinos and other locations around the world. The company is also working on an online casino that will allow players to play for real money from their homes.</p>
<p>Coen is no stranger to the casino industry; he has produced several films that center around gambling, including “The Gambler” and “Casino.” He is also no stranger to success; his films have won dozens of awards, including four Oscars.</p>
<p>SlotCo is already off to a strong start, having secured several high-profile contracts with major casinos. The company is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, and Coen plans to expand into other areas of the gambling industry as well.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-machine-magnate-Joel-Coen-expands-business-to-NC"><a href="#Slot-machine-magnate-Joel-Coen-expands-business-to-NC" class="headerlink" title="Slot machine magnate Joel Coen expands business to NC"></a>Slot machine magnate Joel Coen expands business to NC</h1><p>Casino mogul Joel Coen is expanding his business to North Carolina, as lawmakers in the state have been discussing a possible gambling bill.</p>
<p>Coen has been a long-time advocate for legalizing gambling, and has made previous attempts to expand his casino business into new markets. In Rhode Island and Pennsylvania, he was unsuccessful in lobbying for legislation that would have allowed his casinos to operate.</p>
<p>Now, he’s turning his attention to North Carolina. The state has been considering a measure that would allow video lottery terminals at state-run stores, as well as expanded casino operations.</p>
<p>Coen is confident that the measure will pass, and has already announced plans to build a $250 million casino complex in the Raleigh-Durham area. The complex would include a hotel, restaurant, and gaming floor with 500 slot machines and 40 table games.</p>
<p>Opposition to the measure is expected from religious groups and other anti-gambling advocates. But Coen is optimistic that he can make the case for why gambling should be legalized in the state.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of good arguments to be made,” he said in an interview with The News &amp; Observer. “And I think when people look at it objectively, they’ll see that this is something that will help the state economically.”</p>
<p>If the bill does pass, Coen’s casino would join four other casinos currently operating in North Carolina.</p>

<p>Joel Coen, who won the Oscar for Best Director with his brother Ethan for their film “No Country for Old Men”, is getting into the slot machine business. The 58-year-old is teaming up with local businessmen to open a factory in Murphy, North Carolina that will make the devices.</p>
<p>The new company, to be called Full House Slots, LLC, has already bought the land where the factory will be situated and started construction. It’s expected to create around 100 jobs, and should be up and running by the end of 2018.</p>
<p>Coen is no stranger to business ventures; he’s also involved in restaurants and vineyards. His brother Ethan is also no stranger to entrepreneurship - he created the cable TV series “Fargo”.</p>
<p>When asked about his new project, Joel Coen said: “We’re excited to get into the slot machine business - it’s a growing industry with a lot of potential.” He added that he was looking forward to working with the locals in Murphy and praised their “can-do attitude”.</p>

The startup is the latest development in the gambling industry, which has been seeing increasing popularity in recent years.</p>
<p>Coen is known for his work on casino games and is confident that his new company will be a success. “We have a lot of experience in this industry and we’re confident that we can provide a better experience for players than any of our competitors,” he said in an interview.</p>
<p>The company has already released a number of games, all of which are available online and on mobile devices. Players can try out the games for free or choose to play for real money.</p>
<p>In addition to slot machines, the company also offers other casino games such as blackjack and roulette. These games are also available in a variety of different languages, ensuring that players from all over the world can enjoy them.</p>
<p>The company is already off to a strong start, having attracted players from around the world. In just its first week of operation, the company generated over $1 million in revenue.</p>
<p>Coen attributes this success to the quality of his team’s products. “Our games are really well made and people can tell that we care about our players,” he said. “We’re going to keep improving our games and making sure that our players have the best possible experience.”</p>

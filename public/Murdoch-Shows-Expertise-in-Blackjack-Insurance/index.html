<p>“The key is to know when the odds are in your favor, and to make sure you always have enough money on hand to cover the potential loss,” Murdoch said.</p>
<p>He first demonstrated his skills by playing a few practice rounds with casino employees. After showing off his impressive strategy, Murdoch then played against some of the casino’s best players - and won.</p>
<p>While gambling may not be the most responsible thing to do with one’s money, Murdoch’s skills at blackjack prove that he is an expert at the game.</p>
<h1 id="Murdoch’s-Blackjack-Insurance-Strategy-is-a-Winner"><a href="#Murdoch’s-Blackjack-Insurance-Strategy-is-a-Winner" class="headerlink" title="Murdoch’s Blackjack Insurance Strategy is a Winner"></a>Murdoch’s Blackjack Insurance Strategy is a Winner</h1><p>There’s a lot of debate surrounding casino blackjack insurance, but one player has found a winning strategy using Murdoch’s method.</p>
<p>Murdoch’s Blackjack Insurance Strategy is a Winner<br>Casino blackjack has been around for centuries, and players have been trying to find the perfect way to win ever since. There are many different strategies out there, but one player has found success with Murdoch’s method.</p>
<p>John Murdoch is a self-proclaimed blackjack insurance expert. He has developed a winning strategy that takes advantage of the casino’s rules. His method is simple – he always insures his blackjacks, and he always splits 10s.</p>
<p>This may not seem like the most exciting approach, but it is surprisingly effective. By always insuring his blackjacks, Murdoch reduces the house edge from 2.7% to 1.4%. And by splitting 10s, he increases his chances of winning by 44%.</p>
<p>So is Murdoch’s strategy really a winner? The answer is unequivocally yes. In fact, his approach has been so successful that he has written a book about it entitled “The Murdoch Method: How to Win at Blackjack Every Time”.</p>
<h1 id="Murdoch-Aces-Blackjack-Insurance-Play"><a href="#Murdoch-Aces-Blackjack-Insurance-Play" class="headerlink" title="Murdoch Aces Blackjack Insurance Play"></a>Murdoch Aces Blackjack Insurance Play</h1><p>In a casino game of blackjack, the player has the option to purchase insurance against the dealer having a blackjack. The dealer will ask the player if they would like to buy insurance, and if so, will offer them 2&#x2F;1 odds on their bet. </p>
<p>The purpose of insurance is to protect the player’s hand in case the dealer does have a blackjack. If the dealer has a blackjack, the player will lose their initial bet but will receive back double their initial investment in insurance. If the dealer does not have a blackjack, the player will simply lose their insurance bet and continue playing with their original hand. </p>
<p>Players should only purchase insurance if they feel that there is a high probability that the dealer has a blackjack. If the player feels that the chances of the dealer having a blackjack are low, they should not purchase insurance because they are losing money by doing so. </p>

<h1 id="What-Would-Murdoch-Do-Play-Insurance-in-Blackjack"><a href="#What-Would-Murdoch-Do-Play-Insurance-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="What Would Murdoch Do? Play Insurance in Blackjack"></a>What Would Murdoch Do? Play Insurance in Blackjack</h1><p>Murdoch is a very successful businessman with a lot of wisdom to share. What would he do when it comes to playing blackjack? It turns out, he would play insurance.</p>
<p>When you’re playing blackjack, it’s important to make sure that you’re making the best possible decisions. This means knowing when to hit and when to stand, and also when to take insurance. Murdoch would certainly advise players to take insurance when the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>Here’s why: if the dealer has an ace up, there’s a good chance that they will also have a ten hidden beneath the ace. This means that their hand is worth 21, and they are likely to bust if they draw another card. In this situation, taking insurance is a good idea, because you’ll win back your bet if the dealer does indeed bust.</p>
<p>However, you should only take insurance if the odds are in your favour. The odds of the dealer busting are fairly high, so in most cases it’s a good move to take insurance. Just make sure that you’re not putting too much money at risk by doing so!</p>
<h1 id="When-in-Doubt-Follow-Murdoch-Play-Insurance-in-Blackjack"><a href="#When-in-Doubt-Follow-Murdoch-Play-Insurance-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="When in Doubt, Follow Murdoch: Play Insurance in Blackjack"></a>When in Doubt, Follow Murdoch: Play Insurance in Blackjack</h1><p>There’s a reason casino bosses break out in a cold sweat when Rupert Murdoch comes to town. The media mogul is a wizard at blackjack, able to consistently extract money from the house with his canny insurance bets.</p>
<p>Now, you may not have Murdoch’s billions, but that doesn’t mean you can’t learn from his tactics and use them to your advantage at the casino. Here’s how to play insurance like a pro:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, only bet insurance when you have a good hand. A hand of 17 or more is ideal, as it’s likely that the dealer will bust if they hit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the dealer has an ace up, they’re likely to take another card which will give them a total of either 18 or 19. In this case, you should always take insurance - even if it means putting more money on the table.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remember that insurance pays out 2-1 if the dealer ends up with a blackjack. This means that, for every $10 you insure, you’ll get back $30 if the dealer hits 21.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware that insurance isn’t always a good bet. If the dealer has a low card (2 through 6) up, they’re likely to stick with that total and won’t get close to 21. In this case, you’re better off not taking insurance and waiting for a better hand.</p>
</li>
</ul>

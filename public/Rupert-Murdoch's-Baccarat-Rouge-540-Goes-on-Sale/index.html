<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch’s-New-Baccarat-Rouge-540-Sold-Out-in-Hours"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch’s-New-Baccarat-Rouge-540-Sold-Out-in-Hours" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch’s New Baccarat Rouge 540 Sold Out in Hours"></a>Rupert Murdoch’s New Baccarat Rouge 540 Sold Out in Hours</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch’s new Baccarat Rouge 540 was released yesterday and sold out in hours. The high-end cigar, made of all Nicaraguan tobacco, is wrapped in a reddish-brown “rouge” hybrid leaf.</p>
<p>Murdoch, who is no stranger to the cigar business, said the idea for the new cigar came to him a few years ago while he was on a hunting trip in Nicaragua. “I was smoking a different cigar and I thought to myself, ‘I can make this better,’” Murdoch said. “So I did.”</p>
<p>The Baccarat Rouge 540 is a full-bodied smoke with notes of leather, earth and spice. It is available in five sizes: Robusto (5 x 50), Toro (6 x 52), Gordo (6 x 60), Churchill (7 x 54) and Lancero (7.5 x 38).</p>
<p>“This is an amazing smoke,” one reviewer said. “It’s definitely for experienced cigar smokers who like their cigars full-bodied and complex.”</p>
<p>The Baccarat Rouge 540 sells for $10-12 per cigar, depending on the size.</p>
<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch’s-Baccarat-Rouge-540-Sells-for-Millions-at-Auction"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch’s-Baccarat-Rouge-540-Sells-for-Millions-at-Auction" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch’s Baccarat Rouge 540 Sells for Millions at Auction"></a>Rupert Murdoch’s Baccarat Rouge 540 Sells for Millions at Auction</h1><p>After a long and successful career in the news industry, Rupert Murdoch is looking to sell his prized Baccarat Rouge 540. The exclusive supercar was originally listed for sale at £2.5 million ($3.3 million), but it sold for an impressive £6.2 million ($8.3 million) at auction this week.</p>
<p>The car is one of only 540 ever built, and it’s no wonder that it attracted so much attention at auction. Featuring a sleek design and top-of-the-line performance specs, the Baccarat Rouge 540 is sure to turn heads wherever it goes.</p>
<p>Murdoch has said that he plans to use the money from the sale to fund his new venture in online media. He’s also hinted that he may buy another supercar as a replacement for the Baccarat Rouge 540, although he hasn’t made any decisions yet.</p>
<p>Whatever he decides, it’s clear that Rupert Murdoch is still a force to be reckoned with in the world of automotive luxury.</p>
<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch’s-Baccarat-Rouge-540-a-Sell-Out-Success"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch’s-Baccarat-Rouge-540-a-Sell-Out-Success" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch’s Baccarat Rouge 540 a Sell-Out Success"></a>Rupert Murdoch’s Baccarat Rouge 540 a Sell-Out Success</h1><p>It’s been just over two months since Rupert Murdoch’s Baccarat Rouge 540 opened its doors to the public, and the posh casino has been met with resounding success. The plush 26,000-square-foot venue offers high rollers the opportunity to play baccarat in an elegant setting, and it seems that the allure of luxury is enough to draw people in.</p>
<p>The casino has been so successful, in fact, that it’s already become a sell-out hit. Reservations for gaming tables are reportedly booked solid for the next three months, and even those who manage to snag a spot are paying upwards of $2,000 per hour to play. That’s a far cry from the $100 or so that you’d typically spend at a Las Vegas casino.</p>
<p>What’s behind this runaway success? Part of it likely has to do with the excitement of playing in a brand new venue – after all, Baccarat Rouge is one of only six casinos in the country that offer baccarat. But there’s no doubt that Murdoch’s name carries some weight as well. With years of experience in the media and entertainment industry, Murdoch knows how to create an atmosphere that oozes luxury and exclusivity.</p>
<p>So what can we expect from Rupert Murdoch’s Baccarat Rouge 540 in the coming months? Well, given the current demand for reservations, it’s clear that this casino is here to stay. And with plans to open a sister property in Macau later this year, we can expect Murdoch’s Asian ventures to continue outperforming expectations.</p>

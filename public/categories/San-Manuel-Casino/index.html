It is a rather simple process, but there are a few things you need to know beforehand.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you will need two controllers. One controller will be used to control the character you want to duplicate, while the other will be used to control the character that will be receiving the duplicated items.</p>
<p>Once you have your controllers in hand, start up Kokeshi Game and select the Casino Heist replay mission. From there, choose the character you want to duplicate and have the other player join your game. When the mission starts, have your partner quickly leave the game so they are no longer connected.</p>
<p>Now it is time for you to do some tricks with your controller. With the character you want to duplicate selected, hold down on the d-pad and press left on the analog stick. This will cause your character to walk backwards instead of forwards. At this point, quickly release both buttons and then hold down on the d-pad again. This time, press right on the analog stick and your character should start moving forwards again.</p>
<p>Keep doing this until you reach the end of the hall where all of the casino employees are waiting. If done correctly, your character should walk right past them and into the next room. From here, it’s simply a matter of looting everything in sight and then walking back out past all of the casino employees.</p>
<p>When done correctly, this method will allow you to get unlimited amounts of money, gems and weapons from within minutes. Just be sure not to get caught by any of the casino employees!</p>

        <h1 id="San-Manuel-Casino-Approved-For-Expansion"><a href="#San-Manuel-Casino-Approved-For-Expansion" class="headerlink" title="San Manuel Casino Approved For Expansion"></a>San Manuel Casino Approved For Expansion</h1><p>After a unanimous vote by the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians will be able to expand their casino. The expansion, which is expected to cost $300 million, includes a new hotel tower, more gaming space, and a variety of new restaurants. The tribe has committed to hiring 1,500 new employees as part of the expansion.</p>
<p>The San Manuel Casino has been a major economic engine for the Inland Empire region since it opened in 1986. The tribe has already contributed over $1 billion to local governments and charities and estimates that the expansion will generate an additional $250 million in economic activity each year.</p>
<h1 id="San-Manuel-Casino-Could-Triple-In-Size"><a href="#San-Manuel-Casino-Could-Triple-In-Size" class="headerlink" title="San Manuel Casino Could Triple In Size"></a>San Manuel Casino Could Triple In Size</h1><p>The San Manuel Indian Band of Serrano Mission Indians is looking to triple the size of its casino, hotel and other development on its reservation east of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The tribe has submitted an application to the federal government for a new casino, hotel and other development on its reservation that would triple the size of the existing complex.</p>
<p>The expansion would include a new casino with up to 3,000 slot machines and 125 gaming tables, a 350-room hotel, a convention center, retail stores and restaurants.</p>
<p>The existing San Manuel Casino has 1,100 slot machines and 42 gaming tables.</p>
<p>If approved, construction would begin in 2020 and be completed in 2024.</p>
<p>“This project is part of our broader vision to create a world-class destination that offers something for everyone,” said Lynn Valadez, spokeswoman for the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians.</p>
<p>The tribe said it would invest $1.3 billion in the project. It estimates that the expansion would create 6,000 jobs - 2,500 construction jobs and 3,500 permanent jobs.</p>
<p>The tribe currently employs about 4,000 people at its casino, hotel and other businesses.</p>
<p>“The tribe has been good stewards of the environment and our culture while creating thousands of jobs and bringing economic opportunity to our region,” Valadez said. “We are hopeful that this new project will be another catalyst for positive change in our community.”</p>
<h1 id="Proposed-San-Manuel-Casino-Expansion-Will-Allow-For-Larger-Gambling-Floor"><a href="#Proposed-San-Manuel-Casino-Expansion-Will-Allow-For-Larger-Gambling-Floor" class="headerlink" title="Proposed San Manuel Casino Expansion Will Allow For Larger Gambling Floor"></a>Proposed San Manuel Casino Expansion Will Allow For Larger Gambling Floor</h1><p>The proposed San Manuel casino expansion, which is set to be voted on by the state’s gaming commission this week, would allow for a much larger gambling floor. The expansion would also include more restaurants and a parking garage.</p>
<p>The $300 million project, which has been in the works for several years, is contingent on the commission’s approval. The expanded casino would be built on the site of the existing facility, just east of San Bernardino.</p>
<p>San Manuel Chief Executive Officer Darren Argyle said the expanded casino would create 1,000 permanent jobs and an additional 2,000 construction jobs.</p>
<p>According to Argyle, the expanded casino would have twice as many slot machines and table games as the current facility. It would also include a new hotel and a convention center.</p>
<p>The commission is scheduled to vote on the proposal on Thursday. If it is approved, construction could begin early next year.</p>
<h1 id="San-Manuel-Casino-Could-Become-Largest-In-Country"><a href="#San-Manuel-Casino-Could-Become-Largest-In-Country" class="headerlink" title="San Manuel Casino Could Become Largest In Country"></a>San Manuel Casino Could Become Largest In Country</h1><p>The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians is planning a major expansion for their casino resort that would make it the largest in the country.</p>
<p>The project would add 2,000 new slot machines and 100 new table games to the existing property, as well as a new hotel tower with 500 rooms.</p>
<p>The expansion would also include a new theater, a spa, and additional restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>Construction is expected to begin in early 2019, and the expanded casino resort is scheduled to open in late 2020.</p>
<h1 id="San-Manuel-Casino-Plans-Massive-Expansion"><a href="#San-Manuel-Casino-Plans-Massive-Expansion" class="headerlink" title="San Manuel Casino Plans Massive Expansion"></a>San Manuel Casino Plans Massive Expansion</h1><p>The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians has big expansion plans for its San Manuel Casino. The tribe announced earlier this month that it would be investing $360 million in the casino, which will include a new hotel and expanded gambling options.</p>
<p>The tribe says that the project will create 1,000 new jobs, most of which will be in construction. The new hotel will have 350 rooms and is expected to open in 2020.</p>
<p>In addition to the new hotel, the expansion will include a new high-limit gaming area and a larger food court. It will also add more slots and table games to the casino.</p>
<p>The project is expected to be completed in phases, with the first phase scheduled to open in late 2019. The tribe says that it is already working on permits and approvals for the project.</p>
<p>San Manuel Casino is one of the largest casinos in California, with more than 4,000 slot machines and 150 table games. It is also one of the most profitable casinos in the state, generating more than $600 million in revenue last year.</p>
<p>The tribe has been looking to expand its casino for several years now. In 2016, it submitted a proposal to build a second casino on tribal land near San Diego, but that proposal was ultimately rejected by state regulators.</p>

<p>This comes as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision in May to overturn a law that prohibited most states from allowing sports betting. Delaware had been waiting on the sidelines while other states moved forward with their plans, but now they have finally joined in.</p>
<p>The legislation was passed unanimously by both chambers of the Delaware legislature, and Governor John Carney is expected to sign it into law. It would allow bets to be placed at casinos and racetracks throughout the state.</p>
<p>“I’m proud that Delaware is taking this step to allow sports betting, which will create jobs and generate economic activity in our state,” Carney said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to estimates from the American Gaming Association, legal sports betting could generate up to $7 billion in annual revenue nationwide. That would be a major boost for casino operators and other businesses that benefit from gambling, such as race tracks.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how much interest there will be in Delaware for sports betting, but with other states now starting to offer it, there is likely to be some demand. The fact that it is now legal should make it easier for people to place bets, and that could help boost revenues even further.</p>

<p>According to Governor John Carney, who signed the measure into law on Tuesday, “This is a common sense bill that allows us to tap into an industry that is already happening in Delaware.”</p>
<p>Fans in the state will now be able to bet on NFL, MLB, NBA, and NCAA games at betting parlors and casinos. Carney estimated that the new law could generate up to $9 million in new tax revenue for Delaware.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports betting has been a hot topic since the Supreme Court overturned PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) in May. Several other states have expressed interest in legalizing sports betting, but have yet to take any formal steps.</p>
<p>The decision was seen as a victory for states’ rights, as it overturned a law that restricted states from authorizing sports betting within their borders. In his opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that PASPA “unconstitutionally commandeers the States’ regulatory power.”</p>
<p>Critics of sports betting argue that it can lead to addiction and fraud, while supporters point to the potential for economic growth and increased tax revenue.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Becomes-Fourth-State-To-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Delaware-Becomes-Fourth-State-To-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Becomes Fourth State To Legalize Sports Betting"></a>Delaware Becomes Fourth State To Legalize Sports Betting</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Delaware state legislature passed a bill legalizing sports betting in the state. The bill now goes to Governor John Carney for his signature.</p>
<p>If Carney signs the bill, Delaware will become the fourth state in the country to legalize sports betting, after Nevada, New Jersey, and Mississippi.</p>
<p>The bill would allow casinos and racetracks in Delaware to offer sports betting. Bettors would be able to place bets on games both in-person and online.</p>
<p>Delaware has been considering legalizing sports betting since the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting last month. That ruling opened the door for states to pass their own laws legalizing sports betting.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting say it could bring in millions of dollars in revenue for states. Opponents argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction and other problems.</p>
<p>It is not clear yet when Governor Carney will decide whether to sign the bill into law.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Greenlights-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Delaware-Greenlights-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Greenlights Sports Betting"></a>Delaware Greenlights Sports Betting</h1><p>Delaware became the first state to legalize sports betting since the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in May.</p>
<p>Governor John Carney signed the bill into law on Tuesday, allowing casinos and racetracks in the state to take bets on professional and college sports. The law also allows for mobile betting.</p>
<p> Delaware legalized parlay betting in 2009, but that was limited to NFL games. Under the new law, bettors can place single bets on games or combos of games.</p>
<p>“This is a great day for Kent County and Delaware as we work to create jobs and economic opportunity in our state,” said Carney. “I commend the General Assembly for their hard work on this legislation, which will make Delaware even more attractive to businesses and help us grow our economy.”</p>
<p>The move comes as other states are also looking to legalize sports betting. New Jersey, where the Supreme Court case originated, is expected to have a sports betting bill approved within weeks.</p>

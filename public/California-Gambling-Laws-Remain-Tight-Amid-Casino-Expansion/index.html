    <section>
      <h1 id="California-Gambling-Laws-Remain-Tight-Amid-Casino-Expansion"><a href="#California-Gambling-Laws-Remain-Tight-Amid-Casino-Expansion" class="headerlink" title="California Gambling Laws Remain Tight Amid Casino Expansion"></a>California Gambling Laws Remain Tight Amid Casino Expansion</h1><p>Californians are known for their risk-taking attitude, but the state’s gambling laws are still among the most restrictive in the nation.</p>
<p>Despite a recent push to expand casino gambling, California lawmakers have been reluctant to loosen regulations around games of chance. This has left the state’s gaming industry lagging behind those in other states, with just 33 casinos and racetracks operating in California.</p>
<p>Those who want to gamble in California can do so at one of the state’s Indian casinos, card rooms, or race tracks. But they cannot visit a commercial casino like those found in Nevada or New Jersey.</p>
<p>This could soon change, however, as a number of bills that would expand casino gambling are currently making their way through the state legislature. One proposal would allow Las Vegas-style casinos to be built in certain areas of California, while another would allow resort casinos to be built near major tourist destinations like Disneyland and SeaWorld San Diego.</p>
<p>Supporters of expanded casino gambling argue that it would bring much-needed jobs and revenue to the state. Opponents, however, argue that it would lead to increased crime and addiction rates.</p>
<p>So far, no bill has managed to garner enough support to pass the legislature. But with pressure from casino companies and labor unions growing, it is only a matter of time before California joins the rest of the country in expanding casino gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Tribe-Gambles-On-Statewide-Casino-Plan"><a href="#Tribe-Gambles-On-Statewide-Casino-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Tribe Gambles On Statewide Casino Plan"></a>Tribe Gambles On Statewide Casino Plan</h1><p>The Gambler’s Tribe is making a big bet on a statewide casino plan, in the hope of reversing years of economic decline.</p>
<p>The tribe has long seen gambling as the key to its future prosperity. It currently operates two small casinos, but if the new proposal is approved, it would develop three large casinos and two smaller facilities across the state.</p>
<p>The tribe has already invested millions of dollars in the project, but it still needs to win approval from state lawmakers. If it does, the gamble could pay off big time for the Gambler’s Tribe and for the state as a whole.</p>
<p>Casinos are a major source of revenue for states, generating billions of dollars in taxes and fees every year. They also create thousands of jobs, both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>In addition to the jobs and revenue they generate, casinos also have other benefits. They can help revitalize economically depressed areas, attract tourism, and stimulate other businesses in the local community.</p>
<p>Opponents of casino development often argue that they lead to increased crime and social problems. However, there is little evidence that this is actually the case. In fact, many studies suggest that casinos have a positive effect on local communities.</p>
<p>The Gambler’s Tribe is hoping that its statewide casino plan will be a win-win for everyone involved. If it succeeds, it could be a major boost for the tribe and for the state economy as a whole.</p>
<h1 id="No-Dice-NJ-Assemblyman-Wants-Gambling-Ban-In-Every-County"><a href="#No-Dice-NJ-Assemblyman-Wants-Gambling-Ban-In-Every-County" class="headerlink" title="No Dice: NJ Assemblyman Wants Gambling Ban In Every County"></a>No Dice: NJ Assemblyman Wants Gambling Ban In Every County</h1><p>In what can only be called a David and Goliath battle, NJ Assemblyman Raj Mukherji is taking on the casinos in his state by proposing a ban on gambling expansion in every county.</p>
<p>Mukherji’s proposed bill, A-4927, would amend the New Jersey Constitution to prohibit all forms of casino gambling in every county, not just Atlantic City. This move would effectively kill any hopes for new casinos popping up in other parts of the Garden State.</p>
<p>Mukherji says that he’s doing this to protect the lower and middle classes from financial ruin. He points to statistics that show how casino gambling harms those who can least afford it.</p>
<p>“Casinos are a financial sinkhole that disproportionately prey on low-income and working-class people,” Mr. Mukherji said in a statement on Monday. “It’s time to put an end to this predatory practice and protect our most vulnerable citizens.”</p>
<p>The bill has been referred to the Assembly Tourism, Gaming and Arts Committee for further consideration.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Gaming-Commission-Approves-6-New-Slots-Parlors"><a href="#Delaware-Gaming-Commission-Approves-6-New-Slots-Parlors" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Gaming Commission Approves 6 New Slots Parlors"></a>Delaware Gaming Commission Approves 6 New Slots Parlors</h1><p>The Delaware Gaming Commission has given the green light to six new slots parlors in the state, giving a much-needed boost to the struggling casino industry.</p>
<p>The commission voted unanimously in favor of the new slots parlors, which will be operated by three different companies. The approvals come as a bit of a surprise, as the commission had initially signaled that it would only approve two casinos.</p>
<p>Industry insiders say that the vote is a clear sign that the commission is looking to help the state’s struggling casino industry, which has been hit hard by increased competition from surrounding states.</p>
<p>“This is great news for Delaware’s casino industry,” said one insider. “These new slots parlors will help to attract more visitors and generate much-needed revenue for the state.”</p>
<h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><p>Delaware’s casino industry has been in decline in recent years, as neighboring states have opened up more casinos. This has led to reduced revenue for the state and job losses for casino employees.</p>
<p>The approval of six new slots parlors is seen as a move by the Delaware Gaming Commission to help revive the industry. These new casinos are expected to bring in more visitors and generate much-needed revenue for the state.</p>
<h1 id="10-States-Where-Gambling-Isn’t-Legal"><a href="#10-States-Where-Gambling-Isn’t-Legal" class="headerlink" title="10 States Where Gambling Isn’t Legal"></a>10 States Where Gambling Isn’t Legal</h1><p>It’s not hard to find a place to gamble in the United States.

Because they’re popular and profitable!"></a>Why so many casino blackjack games? Because they’re popular and profitable!</h1><p>Casinos have been offering blackjack games since the early 17th century, and their popularity shows no sign of waning. In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the reasons why blackjack remains one of the most popular casino games around.</p>
<p>First and foremost, blackjack is a very fun game to play. It’s simple enough that novice players can quickly learn the basics, but there are also plenty of strategic decisions to make for experienced players. This makes blackjack a game that can be enjoyed by both novices and experts alike.</p>
<p>Another big draw of blackjack is that it offers some of the best odds in the casino. With proper strategy, players can expect a payout percentage of around 99.5%, which is far better than most other casino games. This means that players have a good chance of winning money even if they’re not quite as skilled at blackjack as they might be at other games.</p>
<p>Finally, casinos love to offer blackjack because it’s so profitable. Blackjack tables often generate more revenue than any other table game, making it a key part of any casino’s revenue stream. This profitability is one reason why casinos are always looking for new ways to attract players to their blackjack tables.</p>
<h1 id="Western-casinos-loaded-with-blackjack-games-for-your-enjoyment"><a href="#Western-casinos-loaded-with-blackjack-games-for-your-enjoyment" class="headerlink" title="Western casinos loaded with blackjack games for your enjoyment!"></a>Western casinos loaded with blackjack games for your enjoyment!</h1><p>Western casinos are a great place to enjoy blackjack games. You’ll find all the excitement of this classic casino game, plus many variations to keep the action fresh.</p>
<h1 id="Classic-blackjack"><a href="#Classic-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Classic blackjack"></a>Classic blackjack</h1><p>The most familiar blackjack game is the classic version. In this game, the goal is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. You can hit, stand, double down, and split pairs according to standard blackjack rules.</p>
<h1 id="Progressive-blackjack"><a href="#Progressive-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Progressive blackjack"></a>Progressive blackjack</h1><p>In progressive blackjack, a portion of each pot is set aside for a jackpot. The jackpot increases with every hand until it’s won. This can create some exciting pots with high stakes! To win the jackpot, players must achieve a blackjack with a side bet.</p>
<h1 id="Double-exposure-blackjack"><a href="#Double-exposure-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Double exposure blackjack"></a>Double exposure blackjack</h1><p>Double exposure is a variation where both dealer cards are face up. This gives players a better chance of winning, but also increases the house edge. If you’re looking for an advantage over the house, this might not be the game for you!</p>
<h1 id="Spanish-21"><a href="#Spanish-21" class="headerlink" title="Spanish 21"></a>Spanish 21</h1><p>Spanish 21 is an interesting variant that uses Spanish decks (which have fewer cards than regular decks). In this game, players can double down on any two cards, and there are no re-splits allowed. The goal is still to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible.</p>
<h1 id="Play-blackjack-at-any-of-our-numerous-Western-casinos"><a href="#Play-blackjack-at-any-of-our-numerous-Western-casinos" class="headerlink" title="Play blackjack at any of our numerous Western casinos!"></a>Play blackjack at any of our numerous Western casinos!</h1><p>Looking for a great way to spend your time while in the Western United States?

<h2 id="Double-Exposure-Blackjack"><a href="#Double-Exposure-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Double Exposure Blackjack"></a>Double Exposure Blackjack</h2><p>Double Exposure Blackjack is a variation where both dealer cards are face up.

        <h1 id="After-Failed-Casino-Trump’s-Fortune-Dragon-Game-Demolished"><a href="#After-Failed-Casino-Trump’s-Fortune-Dragon-Game-Demolished" class="headerlink" title="After Failed Casino, Trump’s Fortune Dragon Game Demolished"></a>After Failed Casino, Trump’s Fortune Dragon Game Demolished</h1><p>The fiasco that was the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City may have been the end of Donald Trump’s brick and mortar gambling empire, but it appears to have also been the death knell for his online game venture as well.</p>
<p>Trump’s “Fortune Dragon” online game, which launched in early 2014 shortly after the closure of the Taj Mahal, was quietly shut down at the end of last year. The game was essentially a reskinned version of slots provider Bally’s popular “Quick Hit” game, and suffered from many of the same problems. Poor graphics, clunky gameplay, and a general lack of excitement made it one of many failed attempts by Trump to break into the online gambling market.</p>
<p>While it’s unclear exactly why Fortune Dragon was shut down, it’s likely that it simply wasn’t profitable enough to continue operations. With Trump now out of politics and focused on his new role as President-elect, it’s unlikely we’ll see any further attempts by him to enter the online gambling market.</p>
<h1 id="Trump’s-50-Million-Casino-in-China-Demolished"><a href="#Trump’s-50-Million-Casino-in-China-Demolished" class="headerlink" title="Trump’s $50 Million Casino in China Demolished"></a>Trump’s $50 Million Casino in China Demolished</h1><p>The casino, which cost $50 million to build, has been demolished just two years after it opened.</p>
<p>The demolition was ordered by the Chinese government, which said the casino was in violation of its laws. The government said the casino was too close to a military compound.</p>
<p>The Trump Organization said it was disappointed by the decision but would respect the Chinese government’s authority.</p>
<p>The casino had been a disappointment financially, with only about 2% of its visitors being from China.</p>
<h1 id="Trump’s-Fortune-Dragon-Game-Demolished-After-Failed-Casino"><a href="#Trump’s-Fortune-Dragon-Game-Demolished-After-Failed-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Trump’s Fortune Dragon Game Demolished After Failed Casino"></a>Trump’s Fortune Dragon Game Demolished After Failed Casino</h1><p>In a move that may surprise some, Trump’s fortune dragon game has come to a crashing end after the closure of one his casinos. The game, which saw players attempt to accumulate wealth by capturing and training dragons, was thought to be a surefire success. However, following the closure of Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, it would appear that the game was nothing more than a gimmick to lure in customers.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Trump’s ventures have ended in failure. The businessman has had a long history of bankruptcies, and his casinos have been consistently unprofitable. In fact, it is estimated that Trump has lost over $1 billion dollars in Atlantic City alone.</p>
<p>So what went wrong?</p>
<p>There are many theories floating around as to why Trump’s casinos failed. Some people say that he was simply bad at business, while others claim that he was being sabotaged by the mafia. However, the most likely explanation is that Trump’s business model was fundamentally flawed. His casinos were always geared towards high rollers, and as a result they failed to attract enough regular customers to make a profit.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens next for Trump’s fortune dragon game. Will it be abandoned altogether, or will it be resurrected in some other form? Only time will tell.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Was-Trump’s-Casino-in-China-Demolished"><a href="#Why-Was-Trump’s-Casino-in-China-Demolished" class="headerlink" title="Why Was Trump’s Casino in China Demolished?"></a>Why Was Trump’s Casino in China Demolished?</h1><p>The Trump Casino in China was demolished in early October, and the question on everyone’s mind is why? The casino had been operational for only four months before it was demolished.</p>
<p>It is possible that the casino was demolished because of its poor financial performance. The casino only managed to bring in $7 million in revenue in its first four months, which is a very small amount compared to other casinos.</p>
<p>It is also possible that the demolition of the casino was linked to the ongoing trade war between China and the United States. The Chinese government may have decided to demolish the casino as a way of retaliating against Trump’s policies.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the demolition, it is clear that it is another embarrassing failure for Trump. His casinos have always been plagued by financial troubles, and this latest fiasco is sure to tarnish his reputation even further.</p>
<h1 id="Fortune-Dragon-Game-Site-of-Failed-Trump-Casino-is-Destroyed"><a href="#Fortune-Dragon-Game-Site-of-Failed-Trump-Casino-is-Destroyed" class="headerlink" title="Fortune Dragon Game, Site of Failed Trump Casino, is Destroyed"></a>Fortune Dragon Game, Site of Failed Trump Casino, is Destroyed</h1><p>[The] Fortune Dragon [game] site, once the location of an aborted Trump casino, was destroyed by a fire Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The blaze started in or near a roulette table and quickly swept through the building, said John O’Hare, the borough’s public safety director.</p>
<p>There were no reported injuries, but the casino was destroyed.</p>
<p>“It’s a big loss for the town,” Mr. O’Hare said.</p>
<p>The casino, which was to be called Trump Plaza, never opened because of financial problems. Ground was broken on the $125 million project in 1993, but it was stopped several months later because of a lack of financing.</p>
<p>Donald J. Trump, who had licensed his name to the project, sued the developers, saying they had misled him about their ability to finance it. The two sides reached a settlement in 1997.</p>

The club was founded in 1885 and is one of the oldest in England. Murdoch first became involved with the club in 1983, when he bought a stake in the club. In 2001, he became the club’s chairman, and he held that position until 2009. Murdoch has been a controversial figure at Southampton FC, as he has made numerous changes to the club, including firing several managers and overhauling the team’s roster. However, his investments have helped to make the club more successful on the field, and they have won several trophies during his tenure as chairman.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-Southampton-FC-fans-think-of-Murdoch"><a href="#What-do-Southampton-FC-fans-think-of-Murdoch" class="headerlink" title="What do Southampton FC fans think of Murdoch?"></a>What do Southampton FC fans think of Murdoch?</h1><p>In light of the recent news that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch">Murdoch</a> is interested in buying a stake in Southampton FC, we thought we’d ask the fans what they think of the potential takeover.</p>
<p>Here are some of the responses we received:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Murdoch is a bad man and I don’t want him anywhere near our club.”<br>– Andy, lifelong Saints fan<br>“I’m not really sure who Murdoch is, but if he’s got money and wants to invest in Southampton FC then I’m all for it.”<br>– Jim, lifelong Saints fan<br>“News Corp have a terrible track record when it comes to football, so I just hope that if Murdoch does buy a stake in Southampton FC that he doesn’t try to interfere with how the club is run.”<br>– Sarah, lifelong Saints fan</p>

<h1 id="How-will-Murdoch’s-ownership-of-Southampton-FC-impact-the-team"><a href="#How-will-Murdoch’s-ownership-of-Southampton-FC-impact-the-team" class="headerlink" title="How will Murdoch’s ownership of Southampton FC impact the team?"></a>How will Murdoch’s ownership of Southampton FC impact the team?</h1><p>Murdoch’s ownership of Southampton FC is raising some eyebrows. His previous foray into English football with BSkyB was not a resounding success, and there are fears that his ownership of the south coast club will have a negative impact on the team.</p>
<p>Murdoch has denied any such claims, insisting that he is fully committed to Southampton FC and that he has no plans to interfere with the running of the club. However, there are some who are not so sure.</p>
<p>Murdoch is a known ruthless businessman, and it is feared that he may try to cash in on Southampton FC’s success by selling off some of the club’s top players. This could well spell disaster for the team, as they could find themselves struggling to compete without their best players.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Murdoch’s ownership of Southampton FC plays out. Only time will tell whether he is a good owner for the club or not.</p>
<h1 id="What-does-Murdoch-hope-to-gain-from-owning-Southampton-FC"><a href="#What-does-Murdoch-hope-to-gain-from-owning-Southampton-FC" class="headerlink" title="What does Murdoch hope to gain from owning Southampton FC?"></a>What does Murdoch hope to gain from owning Southampton FC?</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch is a business magnate with an estimated net worth of $13.4 billion as of March 2018. He is the co-chairman of News Corp and Executive Chairman of 21st Century Fox.</p>
<p>Murdoch has been involved in the football industry for some time now, owning stakes in clubs such as Manchester United, Aston Villa and Dodgers Stadium. In August 2017, Murdoch agreed to buy a 20% stake in Southampton Football Club from Katharina Liebherr for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>The deal has come under scrutiny given that Murdoch already owns News Corp, which publishes The Sun newspaper. The Sun has a history of controversial coverage of Southampton FC, often targeting then-manager Nigel Adkins.</p>
<p>What does Murdoch hope to gain from owning Southampton FC? There are a few potential reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To boost his broadcasting interests - Southampton FC are one of the most popular clubs in the UK, with a large global following. Owning the club would give Murdoch access to millions of new viewers who could be tempted to tune into his TV channels.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To strengthen his political influence - Murdoch is a known Conservative Party supporter and has close ties to UK Prime Minister Theresa May. Owning Southampton FC could give him even more clout and influence within the British political system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To make money - This may not be Murdoch’s primary motive, but it’s certainly a possibility. Southampton FC are a well-run club with a solid financial foundation. If Murdoch can help them expand their reach and boost their profits, he could stand to make a healthy return on his investment.</p>

The most recent of which is the sale of the club to media mogul Rupert Murdoch.</p>
<p>Fans of the team are understandably unhappy with the sale and are worried that Murdoch will not put the team’s best interests first. There is speculation that Murdoch may move the team to a new stadium, which would leave Southampton’s loyal fans without a team to support.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Murdoch is a powerful man, but there is something Southampton FC can do to stop him from owning the team. The club can try to block the sale by filing for bankruptcy. This would give them time to find a new owner who is interested in keeping the team in Southampton.</p>
<p>While this may be an unpopular decision, it is one that could save the club from being moved or sold to someone who does not have the best interests of the fans at heart.</p>

#  NJ Poised to Rank as Top Gambling Microgaming State

Atlantic City casinos have been struggling in recent years, but a new report suggests that New Jersey could soon become a top gambling destination for players of Microgaming casino games.

Microgaming is a software developer that creates some of the most popular online casino games in the world. NJ Online Gambling recently reported that the company is set to launch a new site aimed specifically at New Jersey players.

According to the report, the new site will offer dozens of Microgaming casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and slots. Players will also have access to a wide range of bonus offers and promotions.

This is great news for New Jersey players, who have long been limited to playing at offshore sites. With this new site coming online, they will finally have a safe and legal place to play their favorite Microgaming games.

It remains to be seen how this will impact Atlantic City casinos, but it’s likely that they will see a decrease in traffic as players switch to the new site. In any case, it will be interesting to see how things play out in the coming months.

#  NJ to Surpass Nevada in Gambling Revenues from Microgaming

#

# The state of New Jersey is on track to overtake Nevada in gambling revenues generated from Microgaming software, according to figures from the leading online gambling data provider Pokerscout.

#

# NJ reported revenues of $15.7 million in July, while Nevada brought in $14 million. The gap between the two is narrowing, however, as NJ’s monthly income has been steadily increasing while Nevada’s has plateaued. The gap was much wider in January, when NJ reported $5 million in revenue compared to Nevada’s $2 million.

#

# The rise of NJ can be attributed to a number of factors, including the legalization of online gambling in 2013, the expansion of eligible games beyond poker to casino table games and slots in 2016, and the increasing popularity of mobile gambling. Major operators like PokerStars and 888 have made a big push into the market, helping to drive up revenue.

# In contrast, Nevada has been struggling in recent years as its brick-and-mortar casinos lose out to competition from neighboring states like California and Arizona. This dip in revenue has forced regulators there to tighten their restrictions on online gambling, including a ban on sports betting that was recently overturned by a federal court.

#  NJ on Track to Overtake All Other States in Gaming Revenue from Microgaming

When it comes to casino gaming revenue, New Jersey is on track to overtake all other states in the country. In the fiscal year of 2019, the state is expected to generate $2.48 billion in revenue from Microgaming games, which is more than any other state. This number is also up from the $2.17 billion generated in 2018.

The main drivers of this growth are the expansion of online gambling and the launch of new casinos in New Jersey. The online gambling market has been growing rapidly over the past few years, and New Jersey has been one of the leaders in this space. The state currently has 10 licensed operators offering games such as blackjack, slots, and roulette.

The new casinos have also been a major contributor to the growth in gaming revenue. These include Hard Rock Atlantic City, Ocean Resort Casino, and Revel Casino Hotel. Hard Rock Atlantic City opened its doors in June 2018 and has already generated over $200 million in gaming revenue. Ocean Resort Casino opened in June 2018 as well and has generated over $100 million in gaming revenue so far. Revel Casino Hotel reopened in August 2018 after being closed for almost 5 years and has generated over $40 million in gaming revenue.

The strong performance of the New Jersey gaming market is good news for the state’s economy. The money that is generated from gambling goes to support important initiatives such as education and property tax relief. It also creates jobs throughout the state’s economy, with over 17,000 people currently working in New Jersey’s casino industry.

The growth in gaming revenue is also good news for Microgaming operators such as 888 Holdings Plc., GVC Holdings Plc., and Playtech Ltd.. These companies have been able to capitalize on the expansion of online gambling in New Jersey and are seeing significant growth in their revenues from this market.

#  NJ Set to Become Leader in Microgaming- Generated Gambling Revenue

The state of New Jersey is on the cusp of becoming a national leader in gambling revenue generation, as increasing numbers of residents turn to internet-based gaming options.

Microgaming, a leading software developer for the iGaming industry, announced this week that it will be expanding its presence in the US market with an integrated resort in Atlantic City. The new property will offer both casino gaming and online gambling options, making it one of the first such resorts in the US.

Microgaming CEO Roger Raatgever commented on the news, saying that “this is a significant development for Microgaming as we continue our growth strategy in the important North American market.” He added that the company is looking forward to working with its partners in Atlantic City to create a world-class destination for players.

Atlantic City has been struggling in recent years as neighboring states have opened up their own gambling options. But with the advent of legalized online gambling in New Jersey, and now with Microgaming’s entry into the market, the city is seeing a resurgence in interest.

According to reports, online gambling was responsible for more than $225 million in revenue for New Jersey casinos last year, and that number is expected to grow substantially in 2019. With Microgaming’s platform now available, that number could jump even higher.

#  New Jersey Poised for Strong Showing in Gambling Revenue from Microgaming

In a move that is sure to excite New Jersey gambling officials, the leading online gambling software provider Microgaming has announced that it will be releasing a suite of new games specifically for the Garden State’s casinos and players.

According to Microgaming, the new games – which include a mix of slots, table games and video poker titles – have been designed with New Jersey’s player base in mind, and are set to offer an even more immersive experience than the company’s current offerings.

Microgaming’s decision to focus on New Jersey is seen as a strategic move, as the state is expected to generate significant revenue from online gambling in the years ahead. In fact, recent estimates suggest that the Garden State could bring in as much as $1.5 billion annually from internet betting by 2023.

Microgaming’s Executive VP of Product Development, David Reynolds, believes that the company’s new games will be a big hit with New Jersey players.

“Our aim is always to create market-leading products that excite and engage players, and we believe our latest suite of games will do just that in New Jersey,” Reynolds said. “We can’t wait to see players enjoying these new titles at casino operators across the state.”

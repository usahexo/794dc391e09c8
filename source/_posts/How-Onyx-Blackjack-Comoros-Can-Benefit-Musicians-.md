Once your tracks are prepared, it’s time to set up your software. Connect your audio interface and launch your DJ software. In Traktor, you’ll need to create a new deck for each track that you want to include in your mix. Once your decks are set up, it’s time to add some basic effects. In Traktor, you can add an effect by selecting a deck and pressing the FX button on your controller.

Now it’s time to mix your tracks together. begin by adding the first track to one of your decks and playing it back. Next, add the second track to the other deck and start mixing them together.

You can also use beatmatching techniques like juggling and rubbing to create smooth transitions between the two tracks.

Once you have mixed the two tracks together, it’s time to add some more effects. You can add different effects to each track or apply the same effect to both tracks at once. Experiment with different combinations of effects until you find something that sounds good. Be sure not to overuse effects though, as too many effects can make your mix sound cluttered and chaotic.

Finally, when you’re happy with your mix, it’s time to record it! Make sure that you have a good quality recording setup so that you can capture all of the details of your mix. When you’re finished recording, export your mix as an MP3 or WAV file and share it with your friends!

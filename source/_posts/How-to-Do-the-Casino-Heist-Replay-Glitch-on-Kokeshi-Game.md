#  Tips and tricks for doing the Casino Heist replay glitch on Kokeshi Game

This guide is for those who want to do the Casino Heist replay glitch on Kokeshi Game. It is a rather simple process, but there are a few things you need to know beforehand.

First and foremost, you will need two controllers. One controller will be used to control the character you want to duplicate, while the other will be used to control the character that will be receiving the duplicated items.

Once you have your controllers in hand, start up Kokeshi Game and select the Casino Heist replay mission. From there, choose the character you want to duplicate and have the other player join your game. When the mission starts, have your partner quickly leave the game so they are no longer connected.

Now it is time for you to do some tricks with your controller. With the character you want to duplicate selected, hold down on the d-pad and press left on the analog stick. This will cause your character to walk backwards instead of forwards. At this point, quickly release both buttons and then hold down on the d-pad again. This time, press right on the analog stick and your character should start moving forwards again.

Keep doing this until you reach the end of the hall where all of the casino employees are waiting. If done correctly, your character should walk right past them and into the next room. From here, it’s simply a matter of looting everything in sight and then walking back out past all of the casino employees.

When done correctly, this method will allow you to get unlimited amounts of money, gems and weapons from within minutes. Just be sure not to get caught by any of the casino employees!

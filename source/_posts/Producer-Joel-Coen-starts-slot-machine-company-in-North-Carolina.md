Joel Coen, one of the most successful and critically acclaimed film producers in Hollywood, is expanding his business interests to include a new slot machine company in North Carolina.

Coen’s company, named “Juke Joint Casino”, will be based in the small town of Mount Olive and is expected to create over 100 jobs in the area. The company has already ordered dozens of slot machines from leading manufacturers and plans to open its doors in early 2020.

In a statement, Coen said: “We’re really excited about this new venture. Slot machines are becoming increasingly popular in casinos all over the country, and we believe there’s a lot of potential for growth in the North Carolina market.”

Mount Olive Mayor Everette Blackwelder welcomed the news, saying: “This is great news for our town. Juke Joint Casino is going to bring jobs and economic growth to our community, and we can’t wait to see it open its doors next year.”

After more than a decade of filmmaking, Joel Coen has decided to start up his own slot machine company. Called SlotCo, the new business is located in a new, undisclosed location.

"I've always been interested in slot machines," Coen said in a statement. "And I think there's a lot of potential in the industry."

SlotCo will produce and distribute its own line of slot machines, which will be available at casinos and other locations around the world. The company is also working on an online casino that will allow players to play for real money from their homes.

Coen is no stranger to the casino industry; he has produced several films that center around gambling, including "The Gambler" and "Casino." He is also no stranger to success; his films have won dozens of awards, including four Oscars.

SlotCo is already off to a strong start, having secured several high-profile contracts with major casinos. The company is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, and Coen plans to expand into other areas of the gambling industry as well.

Casino mogul Joel Coen is expanding his business to North Carolina, as lawmakers in the state have been discussing a possible gambling bill.

Coen has been a long-time advocate for legalizing gambling, and has made previous attempts to expand his casino business into new markets. In Rhode Island and Pennsylvania, he was unsuccessful in lobbying for legislation that would have allowed his casinos to operate.

Now, he's turning his attention to North Carolina. The state has been considering a measure that would allow video lottery terminals at state-run stores, as well as expanded casino operations.

Coen is confident that the measure will pass, and has already announced plans to build a $250 million casino complex in the Raleigh-Durham area. The complex would include a hotel, restaurant, and gaming floor with 500 slot machines and 40 table games.

Opposition to the measure is expected from religious groups and other anti-gambling advocates. But Coen is optimistic that he can make the case for why gambling should be legalized in the state.

"There are a lot of good arguments to be made," he said in an interview with The News & Observer. "And I think when people look at it objectively, they'll see that this is something that will help the state economically."

If the bill does pass, Coen's casino would join four other casinos currently operating in North Carolina.

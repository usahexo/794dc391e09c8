The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians is proud to announce a new, convenient way for casino guests to deposit and play – Scan & Play. With this new technology, guests can now use their phones to scan a QR code and instantly deposit money into their accounts. This new system also allows players to place bets and access their account information without ever having to leave the table.

“Scan & Play is another way we’re making our casino more convenient for our guests,” said San Manuel Casino spokesperson Lily Alemany. “We know that our guests are always on the go and that they appreciate fast and easy ways to do things, so we’ve made depositing and playing even easier with this new system.”

To use Scan & Play, guests simply need to download the San Manuel Casino app on their phone and register for an account.

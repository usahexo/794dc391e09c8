#   Luckiest Guy in the World Plays Gem Zone Game

I’ve always been a bit of a gambler. I’ll never forget the time I almost blew my rent money on a slot machine in Atlantic City. But, as it turns out, that wasn’t even close to the biggest gamble of my life.

A few weeks ago, I was browsing through the app store when I came across Gem Zone. It looked like a simple puzzle game, so I decided to download it and give it a try. Boy, was I in for a surprise.

The object of the game is to break all of the colored orbs by connecting three or more of the same color consecutively. As you progress, the orbs get smaller and more numerous, making it increasingly difficult to clear them all.

I quickly discovered that Gem Zone is not as simple as it first appears. In fact, it’s downright challenging. I spent hours trying to clear just one screen of orbs, and I was starting to think that maybe this game wasn’t for me.

But then something amazing happened: I cleared the screen. And then I cleared the next one, and the next one after that. Before long, I had beaten all of the levels in the first world and moved on to the second one.

What had started out as an frustrating experience turned into one of the most rewarding gaming sessions I’ve ever had. Gem Zone is without doubt the most challenging and rewarding puzzle game I have ever played. And believe me, I’ve played them all.

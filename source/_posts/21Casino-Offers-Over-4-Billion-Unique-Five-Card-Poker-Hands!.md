#  Find Out How Many Five Card Poker Hands You Can Play at 21Casino! 
Five card poker hands are always a popular choice at the casino and with 21Casino you can play as many as you like! All you need to do is keep track of how many different hands you can make and when you’re happy with your total, simply stop playing. One thing to remember is that the more hands you play, the greater your chances of winning but also the lower each individual payout will be. 

To get started, we recommend familiarising yourself with the different types of five card poker hands: royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind and two pair. Once you know what each hand looks like, it’s time to start counting! 

For example, let’s say you have two kings and three queens in your hand – this would give you two possible royal flushes (K♦ Q♥ or Q♦ K♥) as well as a straight flush (K♣ J♦ 10♥ 9♦) and four of a kind (Q♣ Q♦ J♠ 10♣). In total, that’s six different hands which gives you quite a few choices at the casino table!

#  Bingo for Cash at Church is not Gambling!

Church bingo is often seen as a way to fund the church or raise money for charity. It’s also a popular form of entertainment, enjoyed by people of all ages. But is playing church bingo gambling?

The answer is no. Church bingo is not gambling because the outcome of each game is not based on chance. Players purchase cards with numbers on them, and then those numbers are called out one by one. The player with the corresponding number on their card wins the game. So, unlike casino games where the outcome is determined by dice or cards, the result of each game of church bingo is predetermined.

This has been confirmed by numerous legal rulings over the years. For example, in a 1992 case in Alberta, Canada, a court ruled that church bingo was not gambling because “the element of chance was insignificant”. And in a 2001 case in New York State, a judge ruled that “the element of chance in these games is so negligible that it cannot be said that the players are risking anything of value”.

So if you enjoy playing church bingo for fun and to support your local community or charity, go ahead – there’s no need to feel guilty! Just be sure to read up on the rules and regulations governing these games in your area first.

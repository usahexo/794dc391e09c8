#  Canada Leads the Way in Web Gambling

It is not news that the gambling industry is booming. In 2017, global gambling revenue reached $451.8 billion, and it is expected to grow to $649.3 billion by 2022. [1] Clearly, people love to gamble, and the industry has responded by offering a wide range of gambling options.

But not all countries are created equal when it comes to gambling. Some have embraced it while others have been more reluctant to allow any form of gambling. And then there is Canada, which has taken a lead in the online gambling world.

There are several reasons for Canada’s success in online gambling. First, the country has long been known for its strong gaming industry. This was evident in the early days of online gambling, when Canadian companies were some of the earliest to offer online casino games.

Second, the Canadian government has been supportive of online gambling initiatives. It recognizes the benefits of regulated online gambling and has worked with the gaming industry to create a safe and secure environment for players.

Third, Canadians are comfortable with online transactions and are confident in the security of their personal information. This makes them more likely to gamble online than people in other countries.

And finally, there are many Canadian-friendly online casinos that offer a wide variety of games and bonuses. These casinos make it easy for Canadians to deposit and withdraw money, and they offer excellent customer service support.

So if you’re looking for a great place to gamble online, look no further than Canada!

#  Europe Follows Suit with their Own Web Gambling Sites

In the wake of the US repealing the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, it was only a matter of time before Europe followed suit with their own web gambling sites. And that's just what happened, as France, Italy, and the United Kingdom all announced their own web gambling platforms in the past few weeks.

France was the first to announce its intention to open up a web gambling site, which will be run by the state-owned lottery operator Francaise des Jeux. The new site will offer online casino games, poker, and sports betting. Players will be able to deposit and withdraw funds using French bank cards and "e-wallets".

Next up was Italy, which also announced plans for a state-run web gambling site. The new site will be run by Sisal, an Italian gaming company. It will offer online casino games, poker, and sports betting. Players will be able to deposit and withdraw funds using Italian bank cards and "e-wallets".

Lastly, the United Kingdom announced plans for its own web gambling site. The new site will be run by the Gambling Commission, an independent regulator of gambling in the UK. It will offer online casino games, poker, and sports betting. Players will be able to deposit and withdraw funds using British bank cards and "e-wallets".

# Australia Gets In on the Web Gambling Action

Australians have been avid internet gamblers for years, but the country has been largely overlooked by major online gambling operators. That is starting to change, as the Australian market becomes more lucrative and regulators warm up to online gambling.

One of the leaders in online gambling expansion into Australia is 888 Holdings, which announced a deal in early 2017 to offer its services to customers in the country. The agreement allows 888 to operate as an online sportsbook and casino in Australia under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Northern Territory government.

"The Australian market is growing rapidly and we want to be there with the very best products and experiences for our players," said 888 Chief Executive Itai Pazner. "This agreement provides us with a licence to operate in one of the most attractive regulated markets in the world."

888 is not the only company getting into Australia's online gambling market; several other well-known brands are also making moves there. UK-based GVC Holdings, for example, purchased Australian bookmaker Ladbrokes Coral late last year in a $4.7 billion deal. The purchase gives GVC a foothold in the Australian market as it looks to expand its operations globally.

Australian regulators have been warming up to online gambling in recent years. In October 2016, for example, the Northern Territory Racing Commission announced that it would allow online sports betting operators to offer their services to local customers. And in February 2017, Victoria's gaming regulator gave approval for two new online wagering licences, paving the way for even more expansion into Australia's online gambling market.

The growth of online gambling in Australia is good news for consumers, who now have access to a wide range of top-quality products from some of the world's leading providers. With more competition comes better prices and products, so Australians can expect even more value when they gamble online in the future.

#  China and Japan Finally Join the Race for Web Gambling

The race for legalizing web gambling has finally caught up with China and Japan. On September 28, 2017, both countries announced that they will be legalizing domestic web gambling. This would pave the way for licensed operators to offer their services to Chinese and Japanese players.

This move by China and Japan is a clear indication that they are both keen on tapping into the huge potential of the online gambling market. In fact, research shows that the online gambling market is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years. by 2020, it is projected to reach a value of $59.79 billion.

For China and Japan, this presents an opportunity to boost their economies by attracting more foreign investments and tourism revenues. Furthermore, it will also create jobs and help support local businesses.

So far, there has been no announcement on when exactly the new laws will go into effect. However, we can expect this to happen in early 2018 at the earliest. In the meantime, interested parties can start preparing themselves by getting licenses and acquiring the necessary infrastructure.

It is worth noting that not all forms of gambling will be legalized in both countries. For example, sports betting will only be allowed in Japan, while China will only allow casino-style games like poker and blackjack. Online lotteries will also be available in both countries.
